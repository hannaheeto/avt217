	<h2>Navigation</h2>
	<p>The navigation of this website is relatively good. There are ways to sort by the products like clothing, music, etc.</p>
		
	<h2>Usability</h2>
	<p>This website feels very usable. All the information is clear about products, pricing, and more. I've purchased from here multiple times and it's always been very simple to use.</p>
	
	<h2>Typography and hierarchy</h2>
	<p>This site has pretty good typography. The font is simple and easy to read, and the spacing betweeen things makes sense. It isn't a struggle to read.</p>
	
	<h2>Overall style/look and feel</h2>
	<p>The style and aesthetic of this site feels very on brand for Billie's current work. One thing about this site is that it changes depending on the aesthetic of her current album. It makes the site feel fresh and up to date.</p>
